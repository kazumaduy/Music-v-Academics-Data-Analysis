# Musical_v_Academics Data Analysis
 
 ### Abstract
 
The purpose of this data analysis is to take a look at a district’s student population and their academic performance based on the classes they were enrolled in. The data of 18,201 students were provided by the school district with information on their grade point average (GPA), marks, class descriptions, class departments, and the year the data originated from. We predicted that students who enrolled consistently in Fine Arts courses, more specifically, musical classes like: Band, Choir, or Orchestra, would have a higher GPA than students who did not. Using linear regression and bootstrap sampling to compare each population at an α = 0.05 (95% confidence). We were able to find that there exists a positive difference in mean GPA between those that have consistently enrolled in these Fine Arts courses than those that do not, suggesting that these courses have a positive influence on student’s academic performance.
